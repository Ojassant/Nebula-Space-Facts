			1. The Sun is 93 million miles from the Earth<br>
			<br>
			2.  The sun is way bigger than the Earth. The sunâ€™s radius is more than 432,000 miles and the Earthâ€™s radius is just under 4,000 miles<br>
			<br>
			3. The Sun is 4.5 billion years old!<br>
			<br>
			4. No matter when or where we look at the sun, we will always see something interesting. Scientists observe these changes by watching the sunspots, which increase and decrease about every 10 years.<br>
			<br>
			5. Mars Boasts  a volcano BIGGER THAN THE ENTIRE STATE OF HAWAII!<br>
			<br>
			6. Spacecraft could bring contaminants to inhabitable (or inhabited) LOCATIONS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM!!<br>

		<p class="facts">
			1. There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on all the beaches on Earth. Thatâ€™s at least a billion trillion!<br>
			<br>
			2. A black hole is created when big stars explode. Its gravitational force is so strong that nothing can escape from it â€“ luckily the closest black hole is about 10,000 light-years from Earth.<br>
			<br>
			3. When venturing into space, astronauts wear spacesuits which have to be warmed, cooled, pressurised and supplied with fresh air. This takes six hours for them to put on!<br>
			<br>
			4. The universe has no centre and is constantly expanding (getting bigger) every second â€“ making it impossible to reach the edge.<br>
			<br>
			5. The Earth is tiny in comparison with the rest of the universe â€“ it could fit into the sun 1.3 million times.<br>
			<br>
			6. A day on Mercury lasts longer than its year! Mercury moves around the sun faster than any other planet â€“ making its year the equivalent of 88 Earth days. While a day on Mercury â€“ the interval between one sunrise and the next â€“ lasts 176 Earth days!<br>
